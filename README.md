# image-upscaling (Sreamlit based)
Contrasting Traditional Upscaling and GAN-Based Restoration for Compressed Image Enhancement

This project explores and compares various image upscaling techniques to enhance compressed images. 
    We examine both traditional interpolation methods and modern deep learning-based approaches, 
    specifically focusing on the differences in quality, artifacts, and overall visual fidelity.
    
    The tool allows you to:
    1. Compress an image to a specified quality level
    2. Apply various upscaling methods
    3. Compare results side-by-side
    4. Analyze image quality metrics


STREAMLIT PLATFORM based
